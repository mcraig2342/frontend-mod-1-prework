## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

My workflow has felt a little choppy. I havent been working for more than about 2 hours at a time at the longest without getting up and taking a break. Sometimes it was hard for me to get back in the groove after taking a break and sometimes the break was just what I needed. I think for me it is important to keep on going when I feel like I am in the zone, and take those poms when I feel myself start to slow down or I feel my brain get a little foggy.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
  * List of states and their capitals
  * List of things to pack for vacation
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
  * List of student names and their cohort
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
  * All my favorite restaurants

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values? 

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
