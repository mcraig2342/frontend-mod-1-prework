## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The Superlearners article made me realize that there is more that I can be doing to become a better, more efficient learner. One of the things that stood out to me was the part about eating foods that have anti brain aging properties. Since reading this article I have researched some of these foods and started implementing them into my diet. I am good at making myself take short breaks when I feel my productivity staring to slip or my brain start to fog, they help me to refocus on work and come back with a better mindset.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
